Some of the concepts behind the proposed project, such as an Ethernet MAC or RISC-V processor are not new, there is a variety of previous works in these areas. This part of the proposal will explore the prior work related to the project. 




\section{Packet Filter Firewall}

Usually, the first line of defence against bad actors, it is firewalls play a vital component in computer networks and can become vastly complex. 
In essence, the job of a firewall is to isolate and restrict acess to an internal network from an external one \cite{BuildingInternetFirewalls}.

There are several types of Firewalls such as packet filters (PF), stateful packet firewalls and application firewalls \cite{FirewallsBook}. 
PFs are considered as stateless and traditionally filter exlcusively on the fields in the network (layer 2) and transport 
(layer 3) layer headers \cite{FirewallsBook}. Such fields include IP addresses, port numbers and protocol type.

Due to this, PFs are inherently simple and efficient. Consequently, they are widely available and can be either implemented in software or in 
hardware \cite{BuildingInternetFirewalls}. The book, \cite{BuildingInternetFirewalls}, also highlights some inherent flaws with PFs. These include not being able 
to suprress a sophisticated attacks and in some cases can be challenging to properly configure. More advanced firewalls can perform deep packet inspection and 
explore the contents of the higher layers to better evaluate a packets true intention \cite{FirewallsBook}. 




\section{Field Programmable Gate Arrays}
First introduced by Xilinx in 1984, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) allowed for large custom logic designs to be recognised without the need for 
expensive application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). More importantly, FPGAs did not suffer from the same scalability issues that
programmable array logic (PAL) encountered and has allowed for larger and more complex designs \cite{30YearsOfFPGA}. 

A big advantage to custom logic is the ability to create highly parallelised designs while also with a lower latency than software based serialised algorithms. 
As such, FPGAs became ubiquitous in both digital signal processing and for accelerating an assortment of computing architectures and processes \cite{FPGAComputing}.
System on chip (SoC) design with custom hardware acceleration modules is an active area research. As \cite{FPGAComputing} points out, there is a focus towards 
using both hardware and software in \textit{edge} devices due to growing numbers of IoT devices.

Several papers, \cite{LwIPFPGAFirewall} \cite{IPFPGAFirewall2000} \cite{packetFilteringFPGA}, have proposed a range of related FPGA based firewalls, all having 
slightly diffrent properties and using different classificiation mechanisms. Each of the propsoed firewalls in the afformentioned papers use custom hardware 
to first detect and then handle the incomming network packet. The key benefit to these firewalls is their high 
performance - namely, low latency, and high throughput. Article \cite{LwIPFPGAFirewall} proposed an ethernet firwall using LwIP and five-tuple binding 
to achieve a throughput of 950Mbps with a latency of 61.266us. A conference proceeding in 2000 \cite{IPFPGAFirewall2000} which used a comparator unit to check the 
fields of the IP header obtained a filtering rate of 500,000 packets per second. 

The enabling concept behind the above FPGA based firewalls is SoC design which involves integrating multiple components into a single package, or in this case a 
single FPGA. Often these will include small softcore microprocessors and some custom ethernet hardware like the proposed packet filters in \cite{LwIPFPGAFirewall}.
Softcore processors are configurable and can be modeled in a hardware description language (HDL) which can then be synthesised onto ASICs or FPGAs hardware 
\cite{SoftcoreBasedEmbeddedSystems}. Recently, the royalty free RISC-V based cores are a popular softcore architecture used on SoC design.


\section{RISC-V processor}
RISC-V, a reduced instruction set computer architecture, is an open and royalty free instruction set architecture (ISA). As a result, a plethora 
of soft-core processors have been made. The specific core proposed in this project is the 'NEORV32` RISC-V processor. It's a highly configurable 
microcontroller like system on chip (SoC) written purely in VHDL.


Due to the open nature of the RISC-V architecture, many designers have made their own System on Chips (SoC) and created their own implementations. RISC-V 
themselves have published a list\footnote[1]{See: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/master/marchid.md} of different RISC-V implementations 
that have a unique architecture ID. The majority of these are either written for application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), written in a hardware 
description language other than VHDL or has poor documentation with the exception of the  \textit{NEORV32 RISC-V} softcore processor. This SoC written 
in vendor agnostic VHDL and importantly has a considerable amount of documentation. 

Being a softcore processor, there is control over which modules are implemented and are not. Some basic features of the \textit{NEORV32 RISC-V} include 
UART, SPI, and GPIO interfaces \cite{neorv32Datasheet}. The datasheet \cite{neorv32Datasheet} also mentions that it supports a \textit{'Wishbone b4'} 
external bus interface. 


A Wishbone B4 (refered to as just 'wishbone') interconnection is designed specifically to connect peices of hardware together on a System-on-Chip (SoC) \cite{WishboneSpec}. In the NEORV32, 
It allows for external hardware modules to be memory mapped into the the 32bit address space on the processor \cite{neorv32Datasheet}.




\section{Ethernet MAC}

First introduced in 1983 \cite{IEEE802.3-2012}, the IEEE 802.3 standardardised a technology, Ethernet, to interconnect devices. There have been 
many attempts at creating hardware for Ethernet MACs. 

The IEEE 802.3 standard\cite{IEEE802.3-2012}, more commonly known by the name of 'Ethernet' defines the \textit{'Medium Access Control'} (MAC) 
protocol amongst other things for two or more devices to communicate over a network. This standard is just one part in the layered network 
models such as the OSI model and TCP/IP models. 






The decision in creating a custom MAC might be considered as interesting given the range of pre-existing Intellectual 
Property (IP) cores for Ethernet on FPGAs. The issue with the pre-existing solutions only have a single output to connect to something like a softcore
processor. To create a firewall, the network traffic would need to pass through the processor. To decrease latency, a second interface can be added 
to the MAC to allow traffic to flow through a hardware-based firewall. This is analogous to the direct memory access (DMA) controller on most modern 
microprocessors. 




\section{Web servers}
... The LwIP library is a popular lightweight TCP/IP stack which has been investigated in a plethora of research papers and projects. 


Recently, FreeRTOS have published their \textit{FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP} library which aims to provide ... over the LwIP stack.
