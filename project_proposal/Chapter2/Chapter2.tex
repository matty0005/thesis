The IEEE 802.3 standard\cite{IEEE802.3-2012}, more commonly known by the name of 'Ethernet' defines the \textit{'Medium Access Control'} (MAC) protocol amongst other things for two or more devices to communicate over a network. This standard is just one part in the layered network models such as the OSI model and TCP/IP models. 


RISC-V, a reduced instruction set computer architecture, is an open and royalty free instruction set architecture (ISA). As a result, a plethora of soft-core processors have been made. The specific core proposed in this project is the 'NEORV32` RISC-V processor. It's a highly configurable microcontroller like system on chip (SoC) written purely in VHDL.
