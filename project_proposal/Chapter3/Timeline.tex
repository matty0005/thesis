\section{Performance Indicators}



\section{Required Equiptment}
While the hardware design will be developed in such a way that it is vendor agnostic, to test the design a Digilent Nexys A7-100T developement board will be used.
Importantly, this board has a RJ45 connector and LAN8720 RMII interface chip which allows for a regular fast ethernet connection to be directly connected 
to the FPGA board. An additional LAN8720 ETH board from Waveshare is also required to obtain the secondary interface. 

To validate the functionality and effectiveness of the design, it will be compared with a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) with a Waveshare CM4-DUAL-ETH-MINI 
daughterboard which contains two 1GbE interfaces. This will act as a baseline.

\section{Project Risk Assessment}

The majority of the work compeleted in the proposed project is digital and poses little risk outside of the standard office sitting.

            Risk       & Severity & Likelyhood & Mitigation  \\ \hline

            Licensing & Minor & Moderate & Avoid software/hardware that requires a specific license. \\
            Data loss & Catastrophic & Unlikely & Ensure all items are backed-up to the cloud and use services such as GitHub where appropriate. Employ a 3 2 1 backup strategy \\
            Hardware Failure & Moderate & Unlikely & Double check all connections to the FPGA board before powering. Reduce excessive handling where necessary to minimise risk of damaging the equiptment \\
            % Electrocution from PoE Ethernet & High & Low & Ensure all items are backed-up to the cloud and use services such as GitHub where appropriate. \\
            Illness & High & Likely & Take breaks periodically to avoid being overworked, and take necessary recovery steps if sick. \\
            Missed Deadlines & Major & Likely & Ensure plans are followed and compelete tasks as soon as possible. If behind, spend extra time on project to catch up.\\
