\section{Project Risk Assessment}

The majority of the work compeleted in the proposed project is digital and poses little risk outside of the standard office sitting.

            \hline
            Risk       & Severity & Likelyhood & Mitigation  \\ \hline

            Licensing & Minor & Moderate & Avoid software/hardware that requires a specific license. \\
            Data loss & Catastrophic & Unlikely & Ensure all items are backed-up to the cloud and use services such as GitHub where appropriate. Employ a 3 2 1 backup strategy \\
            Hardware Failure & Moderate & Unlikely & Double check all connections to the FPGA board before powering. Reduce excessive handling where necessary to minimise risk of damaging the equiptment \\
            % Electrocution from PoE Ethernet & High & Low & Ensure all items are backed-up to the cloud and use services such as GitHub where appropriate. \\
            Illness & High & Likely & Take breaks periodically to avoid being overworked, and take necessary recovery steps if sick. \\
            Missed Deadlines & Major & Likely & Ensure plans are followed and compelete tasks as soon as possible. If behind, spend extra time on project to catch up.\\
