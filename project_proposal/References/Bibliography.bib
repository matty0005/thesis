% ***************************************************
%This example bibliography provides examples of a few different types of references. 
%You should make your own .bib file. You can do this directly from Mendeley, or by exporting a reference of list in BibTex format from your Endnote library, or an online database, etc.

%IMPORTANT: If using Endnote to create your bibliography please ensure you have manually populated the LABEL field of all your references as this is the citation key. This is not done automatically by Endnote, and is required for citing references in LaTeX.

%If you want to make separate Bibliography for each Chapter then you can make separate .bib file for each individual Chapter and call them at the end of that Chapter.tex file.

@incollection{FirewallsBook,
abstract = {The purpose of the firewall and its location is to have network connections traverse the firewall, which can then stop any unauthorized packets. A simple firewall will filter packets based on IP addresses and ports. A useful analogy is filtering your postal mail based only on the information on the envelope. You typically accept any letter addressed to you and return any letter addressed to someone else. This act of filtering is essentially the same for firewalls. This chapter refers to the secure network as the internal network; the insecure network is the external network. The remainder of this chapter provides an overview of firewall policies, designs, features, and configurations. Of course, technology is always changing, and network firewalls are no exception. However, the intent of this chapter is to describe aspects of network firewalls that tend to endure over time.},

@inproceedings{AttackVectorIoT,
abstract = {The advent of the twenty-first century has seen a myriad of amazing technological advancements. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a prime example of technological capabilities at its finest. The IoT is a series of interconnected devices capable of sending and receiving data over existing network infrastructure, but why does this matter? Technology is becoming a conventional commodity, while the uses are endless, technological advancement constitutes a very serious risk. Any device that is connected to the Internet poses a heightened security risk. These risks have the potential of compromising the device and its users. Therefore, the understanding of device-level security is critical to protect the users from various security threats. To provide a holistic view of IoT security, the investigated devices are broken down with respect to different domains (e.g., healthcare, commerce, and home). Specifically, this paper presents a survey of frequently used devices with a common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) for each investigated IoT domain. This will be an attempt to identify the pivotal device vulnerabilities and determine which attack vectors are predominately exploited in IoT networks.},
