This chapter provides the necessary background and reasoning behind the proposed project. 

\section{Background }
In a technology age of growing numbers of cyber attacks and growing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices being interconnected, it's 
paramount to ensure these devices operate safetly and securely.

There are a plethora of different ways to reduce the likelyhood of cyber attacks.
A common approach is to employ a firewall to filter out potentially malicious packets. 

This project focuses primarily on securing edge IoT Ethernet networks. 


\section{Aims}

The aims of the proposed FPGA Ethernet controller and web interface on a RISC-V processor are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increase security to edge IoT networks.
    \item Increase the power efficiency for wire-speed firewalls.
\end{itemize}
