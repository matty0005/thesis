This chapter provides the necessary background and reasoning behind the proposed project. 

\section{Background }


In a technology age of growing numbers of cyber attacks and record number of connected devices, it's 
paramount to ensure these devices operate safetly and securely. In the 2021-22 financial year the Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) recieved in 
excess of 76,000 cybercrime reports and growing \cite{acsc_2022}.

There are a plethora of different ways to reduce the likelyhood of cyber attacks.
A common approach is to employ a firewall to filter out potentially malicious packets. 

This project focuses primarily on securing edge IoT Ethernet networks. 

\section{Defining IoT edge netwoks}


\section{Aims}

The aims of the proposed FPGA Ethernet controller and web interface on a RISC-V processor are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increase security to edge IoT networks.
    \item Increase the power efficiency for wire-speed firewalls.
\end{itemize}


\section{Establishing Exclusions}

While the proposed project will reduce the likelyhood of network based attacks it is not a \textit{'one size fits all'} solution. 
By the nature of the IoT and edge network ecosystem, there are a myriad of different attack vectors where not all of them will be detectable at the
netowrk level.

The proposed project will \textbf{not}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Protect against all attacks
    \item Be able to protect against all IoT devices.
    \item Not perform routing
\end{itemize}
