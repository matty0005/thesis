TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_control/inst/clk_in is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_100_clk_master and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_100_clk_master] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_100_clk_master are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_100_clk_master]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT ethernet_mac/rmii_int/tx_fifo/isFull_reg_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources.

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 1647 control sets (vs. available limit of 15850, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 79 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
