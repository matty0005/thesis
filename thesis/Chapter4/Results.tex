To ensure that the firewall was performing properly, a few tests were conducted. In this chapter, the testing results for the performance and the resource utilisation among other features are discussed. 

\section{Modifications}
The design was changed from the 2 ethernet interfaces to a design with just a single ethernet interface. 

\section{Performance}

Talk about wishbone bus speed. 
Initial tests were also conducted at 100MHz, but due to timing issues, it was reverted to 50MHz.

\section{Ultilisation}

Could be a big section where i take a look at the design against the number of rules - show power usage and gate consumption.
