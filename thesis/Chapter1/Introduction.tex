\section{Motivation}


In a technology era of increasing numbers of cyber attacks and record number of connected devices, ensuring these devices operate safely and securely is 
paramount. The Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) received in 
excess of 76,000 cybercrime reports and growing in the 2021-22 financial year \cite{acsc_2022}. The growing trend of Internet of Things (IoT) will provide 
more opportunity for black hats (malicious attackers). IHS Markit estimates 125 billion IoT devices will be connected by 2030 \cite{IHS_iot}.
This proliferation of IoT devices necessitates robust and adaptable security measures to counter the evolving threats posed by malicious actors. 

To manage the surge of IoT devices, a shift to edge computing has emerged in favour of the traditionally more centralised cloud computing 
architectures. Edge computing as \cite{EdgeComputing} puts it, is the paradigm which involves the computation and analysis of data 
at the \textit{edge} of the network to be as close as possible to the source of the data. This has many advantages including: lower latency, lower bandwidth requirements,
enhanced availability, energy efficiency, improved security and privacy \cite{EdgeComputing}. Consequently, smaller and more efficient computers can be deployed 
at the edge/perimeter of these networks \cite{EdgeComputingPerspectives}. 



\section{Aim and Objectives}

As with any networked device, IoT devices are also vulnerable and at risk due to their lower availability to protect themselves. To help alleviate the growing number of cyber attacks, this thesis aims to increase IoT security by designing and implementing a hardware firewall on a FPGA for use with a RISC-V processor. The key objectives of this thesis are:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Design and implement a hardware firewall on a FPGA that is capable of filtering packets at wire-speed.
    \item Decrease the latency of hardware firewalls in embedded systems. 
    \item Implement a HTTP webserver on the RISC-V processor to allow for configuration of the firewall.
    
\end{itemize}
